    faq2Question: '2. Is sending invoices in PDF by email sufficient?',

    faq3Question: '3. What software is compatible in Belgium?',
    faq3Answer: 'Many Belgian solutions like Accountable, Billit, Trustup Pro, Odoo or Yuki are already compatible with Peppol. The choice depends on the size of your company, your needs and your budget.',
    faq4Question: '4. What is the cost of this transition?',
    faq4Answer: 'Costs vary according to the chosen solution. However, significant tax benefits exist to lighten the investment, notably a 120% deduction on software costs for SMEs and a 20% deduction for digital investment.',
