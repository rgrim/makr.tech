          <h3>Strategic Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>
            I don&apos;t just take orders. I&apos;m the person called into complex meetings to find clarity. I optimize business processes before writing a single line of code, ensuring we solve the right problem, not just the obvious one.

          <h3>Rapid & Robust Execution</h3>
          <p>
            Using Low-Code (Mendix) and AI as my unfair advantage, I build solutions faster and smarter than traditional methods. Solid software architecture that scales with your business ambitions.
          </p>

          <h3>People-Centric Empowerment</h3>
          <p>
            I don&apos;t just build software, I build consensus. Through coaching, knowledge transfer, and inclusive leadership, I ensure your team adopts, owns, and evolves the solutions we create together.
