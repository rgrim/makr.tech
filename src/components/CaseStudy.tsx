          <h3>ðŸŽ¯ The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            A leading manufacturing firm was losing an estimated <strong>â‚¬200k annually</strong> due to inefficient scheduling and manual coordination between their warehouse and shipping departments. Their existing process was a chaotic mix of spreadsheets, emails, and phone calls, leading to costly errors and delays.

          <h3>ðŸ”§ My Action</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of immediately building software, I started by leading a series of <strong>process mapping workshops</strong> with both teams. By simplifying the workflow and identifying key decision points, we designed a streamlined digital process first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only then did I architect and build a central Mendix application that gave everyone a single source of truth. A key part of the project was <strong>coaching their IT lead</strong>, empowering them to manage and make small modifications themselves.
